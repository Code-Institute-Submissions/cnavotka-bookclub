# BookClub

This Project is the Milestone 3 of the Code Institute Diploma in Software Development.
Aims to provide a place where members of a Bookclub can write a summary of a book and the main insights they got from reading a book. Also, the user will be able to create any list of books they want and share with other users if desired. In case they like any book of another member, a link is supplied to purchase it.
